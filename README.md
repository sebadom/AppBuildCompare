# npmAsBuildTool

This is just a test on how npm scripts would allow us to achieve the same expected outcomes that build tools like Gulp or Grunt.
So far this mini test lints the code, then test it with istanbul implemeting mocha. On any error (exit code other than 0) the process is exited with an error.

So far so good :)
